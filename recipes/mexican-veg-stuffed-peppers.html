        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These vegetarian stuffed peppers have a flavorful and cheesy Mexican-inspired filling made with rice, black beans, and tomatoes, spiced with chili and cumin. My kids loved them! If you have small bell peppers, use more of them for this recipe. They taste great with a dollop of sour cream on top.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>4 large green bell peppers - tops, seeds, and membranes removed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can chili-style diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend (such as Sargento® Authentic Mexican)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Add green bell peppers and cook until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. This will prevent the bell peppers from becoming crispy as they bake.</li>
            <li>Drain bell peppers and arrange cut-side up in a 9x9-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked onion into a large bowl; add rice, black beans, and tomatoes. Stir in chili powder, garlic salt, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until well combined. Fold in 1 1/2 cups Mexican cheese blend.</li>
            <li>Spoon rice mixture evenly into bell peppers; sprinkle with remaining Mexican cheese blend.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
